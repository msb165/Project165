Project 165 is a small content mod with the goal of expanding and overhauling the game.

This mod features:

- 3 Bosses (one post-Mechanical Bosses, one post-Golem and one post-Moon Lord)
- 3 new enemies
- 34 Items

Besides adding more content, this mod makes some changes to the vanilla game, here's what it changes:

- Moves the Frost Legion event to pre-Hardmode.
- Makes the Chlorophyte Saber a true melee weapon, only spawning projectiles uppon hitting an enemy.
- Enchances Frost Bolt Staff's projectile visuals.
- Changes some of the gem staves to make them a bit different from each other.
- Increases Terragrim's drop chance from 2% to 50%.
- Makes the hold animation of staves smoother.
